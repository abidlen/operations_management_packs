The JSON files here represent the Management Pack Designs created when using the Managemnet Pack Builder (MPB) (https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/aria/aria-operations-for-integrations/2-0/management-pack-builder-2-0/management-pack-builder.html). You can take these designs, import them into your local installation of MPB, and further customize them as you choose.

The PAK files are the Management Packs themselves, ready for import into your Operations instance.
